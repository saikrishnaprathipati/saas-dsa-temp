						<h1>What happens next</h1>
						<p>You have successfully submitted the DSA application. We we will let <span
								th:text="${studentFirstName}"></span>
							know that their Disability Advisor has completed an application on their behalf.</p>
						<p>The student will need to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>check that the details on the DSA application are correct</li>
							<li>sign the student declaration</li>
							<li>confirm the bank account details of where they would like their award to be paid</li>
							<li>submit the application</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If they believe that any of the information is incorrect, or they are unable to accept the
							declaration and submit the application for any reason, they will need to select ‘I do not
							agree’ on the student declaration and get in touch with their Disability Advisor to discuss
							the next steps.</p>
						<p>Once we have received and processed the application, we will notify the Disability Advisor
							and the Learning Support Team via email that an award decision has been made. You can also
							sign in to your DSA Account at any time to see the progress of this application.</p>
						<strong>If you need to make changes</strong>
						<p>You can only change the application once the student has reviewed the application and clicked
							on ‘I do not agree’. If the student does nothing, the application will remain locked and
							cannot be edited or processed by SAAS.</p>
